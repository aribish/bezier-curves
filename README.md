# Splines
A fun little spline generator

This is just a small weekend project that I created after watching "The Continuity of Splines" by Freya Holmec on Youtube.
I recommend you watch at least the first couple minutes of this video before using the program if you aren't familiar with 
splines, and highly recommend watching it in its entirety if you have the time.

Also, yes, I know that having just about everything in the main function is bad. If I return to this project later, I will be sure to fix that.
And if you're interested in the source code, beware, I made this in just one weekend, and the code is probably very messy.

## Controls
Left/Right Arrows - Changes the type of spline. Right now there are only two: quadratic and cubic.

Left Click - Adds a new point

Right Click - Moves the position of the control point

Space - Draws the spline(s)

C - Clears all points and lines
