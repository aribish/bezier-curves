# Bezier Curves
A fun little bezier curve generator

This is just a small weekend project that I created after watching "The Continuity of Splines" by Freya Holmec on Youtube.
I recommend you watch at least the first couple minutes of this video before using the program if you aren't familiar with 
splines, and highly recommend watching it in its entirety if you have the time.

I will be adding more programs and modifying the existing one in the future, but I need to learn a little more about the
math behind bezier curves, which is much more involved that I thought. I don't know anything about precalc :(

## Controls
Left/Right Arrows - Changes the type of curve. Right now there are only two: quadratic and cubic.

Left Click - Adds a new point

Right Click - Moves the position of the control point

Space - Draws the curve(s)

C - Clears all points and lines
