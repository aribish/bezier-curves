# Splines
A fun little spline generator

This is just a small weekend project that I created after watching "The Continuity of Splines" by Freya Holmec on Youtube.
I recommend you watch at least the first couple minutes of this video before using the program if you aren't familiar with 
splines, and highly recommend watching it in its entirety if you have the time.

## Controls
Left/Right - Changes the type of spline. Right now there are only two: quadratic and cubic.
Left Click - Adds a new point
Right Click - Moves the position of the control point
Space - Draws the spline(s)
C - Clears all points and lines
